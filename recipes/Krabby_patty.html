    <H3><strong>Steps</strong></H3>
    <h4>Patty</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>First, preheat the oven to 360ºF (180ºC).</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and allow them to saute for 2-3 minutes (or until they become translucent).</li>
        <li>Then, add the dried thyme, give the mixture a good stir, and allow it to cool completely. </li>
        <li>Once the onions have cooled, mix together all of the patty ingredients in a large bowl. You can use your hand if needed, but wear gloves. Otherwise, use a food processor or a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Once the patty mixture is made, divide it into two large patties. Then, shape them into flat discs. You can make them large and flat or small and thick.</li>
        <li>To fry the patties, heat some more oil in a medium-high frying pan. Add the patties and allow them to cook for roughly 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Once they are all fried, place them in a roasting tray and bake them for another 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Borger</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To start, place your cooked Krabby Patty onto the bottom sesame seed bun.</li>
        <li>Then, add the freshly washed and dried lettuce leaves. You can follow with some slices of American cheese, sliced onions, and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Next, you can add as much sauce as you'd like. This is all to your liking.</li>
        <li>And finally, add your pickle and add the top bun to the burger.</li>
    </ol>
